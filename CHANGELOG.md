# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Home Assistant integration with explicit source enrollment, native setup and options, dependency-aware monitoring, notification requests, health queries, and restart persistence.
- Python 3.14 development environment and integration tests against Home Assistant 2026.9.3.
- Named functions with stable entity requirements, editable importance, and individual readiness sensors.
- Entity-bound situation alerts, independent of equipment dependencies and readiness, preserving open episodes through unknown evidence.
- Versioned notification events, durable outbox replay, a Companion app consumer blueprint, activation summaries, and visible consumer gaps.
- One shared check command for local development, CI and commit hooks; expanded regression/blueprint tests, event documentation and an implementation roadmap.

### Changed

- New configurations default to notifications off. Consumer automations own episode notification delivery; native persistent notifications remain for Homeostatic errors.
- The original development snapshot upgrades to the current envelope without replacing episode identities.
- CI uses the reviewed HealthTree baseline including accepted situation ADRs.

### Fixed

- Preserve source transitions while storage is busy instead of replacing them with the latest state.
- Preserve setup-retry onset across unsuccessful attempts.
- Retain useful notification content when observations become unknown and policy requests no update.
- Complete unload cleanup even when the final storage write fails, with a visible storage error.
