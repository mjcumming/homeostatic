# Homeostatic UI: ideas worksheet

Owner-facing plans and working notes for `homeostatic`. Sections 16 and 17 record owner decisions; earlier explorations remain proposals unless adopted there. Accepted product direction is distinct from implemented behavior: `docs/spec.md` controls the integration implementation, and the library RFP and ADRs control health and attention semantics.

Expanded 2026-09-24. Layout remains open. This worksheet names owner tasks, proposes workflows and priorities, and distinguishes existing library behavior from integration work. Owner requirements include user-created alerts; section 14 explores the mechanism. Recommendations remain proposals for review, not accepted library changes. The ADR index now records ADRs 0024 through 0028 as accepted.

The UI's job is to answer: **What can my house do, what is preventing it, what am I not watching, and what should interrupt me?** Adding integrations, devices, and alerts establishes that picture. Understanding and maintaining it is the larger job.

The library already fixes the model. The integration supplies nodes, checks, observations, durations, and policy data, and it carries deliveries out. See RFP sections 7 and 11, and ADR 0010 and ADR 0018.

The original three configuration surfaces are retained below. The expanded design exploration then covers first setup, functions, daily operation, evidence, maintenance, migration, and implementation gaps. These are jobs to support, not a commitment to a particular set of tabs.

| Surface | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration | What timings and integration settings does the owner live with? |
| What to monitor | Which parts of the house become nodes, checks, and edges? |
| Notifications | Who hears what, how loudly, and when? |

Mark each row when we decide it: **v1**, **later**, or **not a control**.

## 1. Configuration

The library fills in no duration. The integration's settings own the ones that are not per check, and they supply fallbacks where the catalog has none (ADR 0018, RFP section 11).

Starting values already written down, all editable:

| Setting | Starting value | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settle` | 2 minutes | Engine |
| `rejoin_grace` | 1 minute | Engine |
| startup grace | 2 minutes | Engine |
| `coalesce_count` | 3 | Engine |
| `coalesce_window` | 60 seconds | Engine |
| `batch` | 30 seconds | Policy |
| `clear_hold` fallback | 2 minutes | Check, when the catalog sets none |
| `unknown_hold` fallback | 15 minutes | Check, when the catalog sets none |

The catalog sets `raise_hold`, `clear_hold`, `ttl`, and `unknown_hold` on each check. `ttl` may be explicitly `None`.

| Requirement | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Edit the eight values above | |
| Override one check's `raise_hold`, `clear_hold`, `ttl`, or `unknown_hold` | |
| See the catalog's value next to an override | |
| Policy time zone, used by quiet hours and digest clocks | |
| Where the watchdog heartbeat goes | |
| Anything else that is integration setup rather than health behavior | |

`batch` is policy data. It is listed here because it is one house-wide duration, in the same family as the engine settings.

Startup grace is applied when Home Assistant reports it has started, not when the integration loads. That is adapter behavior, not a second control beside the duration.

## 2. What to monitor

RFP section 11 names where nodes come from. It does not say whether the owner opts in, opts out, or gets the whole inventory.

Sources:

- Supervisor host, core, add-ons, config entries, devices, automations, scripts
- External hosts and functions the owner declares
- Maintenance nodes the catalog splits off, such as updates and backups (ADR 0019)

Edges are a separate decision from "include this thing":

- Registered directly: `config_entry_id`, `via_device_id`, `parent_device_id`
- Candidates the owner confirms: entities an automation references
- Declared by the owner: relationships Home Assistant cannot see

A wrong edge mutes a real failure. A missing edge costs at most an extra message.

Selection and the graph are different controls. Collapsing them into one picker would hide that.

| Requirement | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Default: watch everything the catalog understands, or start from an empty selection | |
| Exclude or include a whole integration (config entry) | |
| Exclude or include an add-on | |
| Exclude or include a device | |
| Exclude or include one check on a node | |
| Declare an external host | |
| Declare a function, and what it depends on | |
| Set a node's importance (`low`, `normal`, `high`, `critical`; default `normal`) | |
| Confirm a candidate edge | |
| Reject a candidate edge | |
| Declare an edge | |
| Remove an edge the owner confirmed or declared | |
| Show what `coverage` would list: no checks, never observed, stale | |

Functions in the stories carry importance because that is what makes an episode urgent. If importance is not editable, the example policy cannot tell the garage from the backyard.

The catalog supplies built-in checks. User-defined conditions and rules are an additional required input, explored in section 14. They must report actual evidence through a defined contract; merely declaring an alert does not close a monitoring gap.

## 3. Notifications

Policy configuration is data with a fixed shape (RFP section 7, ADR 0010). ADR 0010 says YAML first, a UI later. This section scopes what that configuration has to express. It does not decide the editor.

A recipient has channels (opaque ids), optional quiet hours, and optional sites. A recipient may be dynamic, such as whoever is home, resolved from context at send time. Context has no fields yet (RFP section 13).

A digest has a clock time and one recipient.

A rule matches a reason's status, reason, category, labels, and deadline through `due_within`, and the episode's importance and age. Rules are ordered. Within one reason the first match wins, and the episode takes the loudest result across its reasons. On a tie, the earlier rule wins. Recipients and timing come from the winning rule, not a union of all matches. A rule sets loudness, recipients, digest, reminder interval, and escalation. Loudness is `record`, `digest`, `notify`, or `urgent`.

The example in RFP section 7 is the shape, not a commitment that every house starts from those six rules.

| Requirement | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Name recipients | |
| Bind each channel id to a Home Assistant notify service | |
| Set a recipient's quiet hours | |
| Set a recipient's sites | |
| Point "whoever is home" at whatever supplies presence | |
| Name digests, with a time and a recipient | |
| Edit rules: match, loudness, recipients, digest, remind, escalate | |
| Reorder rules | |
| Ship a starting policy the owner can replace | |
| Keep the first editor as YAML | |

Channels stay opaque in the library. The binding to a notify service is integration configuration.

Order carries meaning. The maintenance rule sits above the urgent rule so a dead battery does not page at night. A UI that adds a rule at the bottom changes who gets woken up.

Shelving, quiet windows, and repairs are not notification settings. They are listed below.

## Adjacent, not one of these three

| Verb | What it does | Why it is separate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shelve an episode until a time | Holds deliveries for that episode | Operator action on one open episode |
| Quiet a node until a time | Stops episodes from opening | Engine window, including its dependents or the whole house |
| `explain`, `impact`, `readiness`, `coverage`, `rollup` | Read the house | Services and Assist tools (RFP section 11) |
| Function health entity | Lets an automation fall back | An entity, not a setting |
| Repair | A fixable problem, such as a new login | Home Assistant repairs, from the catalog's remedy |

## Still to argue

- Per-check duration overrides, or only the two fallbacks.
- Opt in, opt out, or the whole inventory.
- Whether importance is edited with the function, or left at `normal` until a later pass.
- Whether notification configuration is YAML only in the first integration, with the table above as the later UI's contents.

## 4. Start with the owner's model

Use familiar Home Assistant things as entry points, and reveal engine concepts when they help a decision.

| Owner's concept | What the UI needs to make clear |
| --- | --- |
| Integration | A specific configured instance. Two instances of one integration can fail independently |
| Device | One recognizable physical thing, potentially containing several monitored capabilities |
| Function | A job the house should perform, such as basement motion lighting or garage operation |
| Check | Specific evidence about one capability, with a source and limits |
| Dependency | Something a capability always requires, whose failure can suppress duplicate episodes |
| View | A room, integration, site, or label grouping; membership never creates a dependency |
| Problem | An episode that persists while its evidence, impact, and urgency change |
| Attention | What the policy and delivery system are doing about that problem |

A Frigate device page can collect detection, recording, and updates. Underneath, detection and recording are distinct capability nodes; updates are a separate maintenance node. A full recording disk must not make motion lighting appear broken. The UI can hide the node count while preserving these distinctions (ADR 0019).

Keep three answers distinct: **observed condition**, **function readiness**, and **notification state**. A device recorded under its failed controller still has its own observed failure. A function can be blocked without having a failed check of its own. Shelving changes delivery, not health. These are presentation distinctions, not new core enums.

## 5. First setup should produce useful coverage

**Recommendation:** discover broadly, offer supported passive monitoring with a scope preview, and activate outbound notifications separately. The owner should not have to create hundreds of nodes or tune every duration. Discovery alone should not start costly or active external probes.

1. **Discover the existing installation.** Show integration instances, devices, automations, scripts, and available host/add-on information. Unsupported sources stay visible as coverage gaps. An installation without Supervisor should explain the unavailable host/add-on evidence.
2. **Review monitoring scope.** Show supported checks, setup requirements, exclusions, and whether future discoveries inherit inclusion. Allow bulk selection by integration, device, area, or label.
3. **Name important functions.** Offer relevant starting points from actual inventory: motion lighting, garage operation, backyard music. This can be postponed, with importance remaining `normal` until configured.
4. **Choose and test recipients.** Distinguish a transport test that sends a message from a policy preview that sends nothing.
5. **Review and activate alerts.** Show day/night examples, maintenance handling, and current problems that would be delivered on activation.
6. **Show remaining gaps and watchdog setup.** Finish with an honest coverage picture and the status of external monitoring of HA itself.

Notification activation is a proposed adapter workflow, not an existing engine feature. Before implementation, specify how already-open episodes, pending messages, and policy state transition into live delivery. Do not mark unsent openings as delivered or replay a backlog blindly.

## 6. Adding integrations and devices

### Integrations

Separate two intents:

- **Connect something new to Home Assistant.** Open native integration setup, then return to monitoring review after discovery. HA's [config flows](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration/config_flow/) own setup, discovery, reconfiguration, and reauthentication.
- **Monitor something already connected.** Select the configured instance, inspect supported checks and devices, review inherited settings and gaps, apply, and see first observations.

An integration detail needs instance identity, observed setup/authentication state, supported checks, supplied capabilities/devices, affected functions, and coverage. Link to its original HA page and available repair/reauthentication flow. Setup should show an already-failing integration rather than require a healthy baseline.

Monitoring the integration itself and monitoring its devices are separate choices. Excluding a controller check must not silently exclude all device checks. Including an integration should offer a bulk action for current devices and an explicit setting for future discoveries.

### Devices and external services

| Owner intent | Proposed workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Monitor an existing HA device | Search by name, integration, area, or label; inspect current coverage; select supported checks |
| Add a new physical device | Hand off to the owning integration's pairing/setup flow where supported, then review discovered monitoring |
| Monitor an entity without a device | Let a supported catalog check use the entity directly |
| Add an external host/service | Select a catalog-supported probe, enter connection details, preview frequency/cost, test, and declare dependents |
| Monitor an unsupported device | Show available evidence and missing capabilities; do not imply full coverage |

Homeostatic should not invent universal device pairing. Nor should successful ping imply the service on a host works. The device page should collect health, maintenance, last verified evidence, checks, dependencies, functions served, and recent problems. Before saving, an owner should understand what the selected checks actually detect.

Use stable source identities. Renaming or moving a device preserves settings and history. Replacing hardware or re-adding an integration needs deliberate remapping; matching display names are not sufficient.

### Inclusion and inheritance

Recommend **inherit / include / exclude**, displaying the effective choice and its source. Proposed precedence: explicit check choice, then device choice, then integration enrollment choice, then installation default. Areas/labels can select bulk operations without becoming competing inheritance rules. The cause graph is not an inheritance tree.

Persist exclusions across rediscovery. Distinguish new devices from new catalog checks on existing devices. Preview catalog changes that add probe cost, change thresholds, or alter routing labels, and preserve explicit overrides.

An excluded capability that a monitored function requires must remain an explicit evidence gap. Recommendation: retain its identity as an unwatched requirement. Simply deleting it can make readiness falsely reassuring. Registration details and existing-episode handling need integration scenarios before adopting this behavior.

## 7. Functions and dependencies deserve first-class editing

A function needs a name, purpose, importance, optional area/site, and required capabilities. Functions can depend on other functions while keeping the graph acyclic. For basement motion lighting, choose detection and the lighting control path; recording is not required merely because the same computer provides it.

Make **importance editable in the first usable release**, especially on functions. Otherwise the policy cannot distinguish the consequences of a failed garage command from unavailable backyard music. Explain importance with consequences, and preview its upstream effect: a controller's episode can become high importance because Garage operation depends on it. Importance is not a direct alert setting; policy still chooses loudness.

A function with no checks of its own can be ready when all required branches are watched and passing. An unwatched terminal requirement makes readiness unknown. A known warning can coexist with an unknown branch, so a degraded summary must not hide missing evidence. This follows the RFP and ADR 0025.

Distinguish **depends on** from **observed failing now**. Episode importance uses all dependents in its impact, not just devices that have already reported failure.

For each dependency, show direction (“A requires B”), capability required, provenance, reason for the suggestion, affected functions, and the separate reports a failed dependency could suppress. Show whether it is active, suggested, rejected, or references something missing.

Preserve the RFP's distinction between registered HA relationships, owner-confirmed candidates, and declared external edges. Automation references are candidates: conditions, optional scene members, and notification targets are not always required. Add/remove actions need an impact preview. Reject cycles with a readable explanation. Preserve rejected candidates across refreshes.

For automatic edges, show provenance and a correction path. Overriding one needs an ownership/reconciliation rule so discovery does not restore it immediately. A wrong edge can hide an independent failure, so bulk confirmation needs more than an unexplained checkbox list.

There is a design tension to resolve carefully: HA association does not establish failure of every physical capability. An integration can fail while a wall switch still operates locally. Apply RFP section 11 to the capability represented by the node and validate mappings against ADR 0019. Broader changes to automatic-edge semantics need an RFP change first. HA's current [device registry documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/device_registry_index/) marks child-device APIs as evolving; check the adapter's target version.

Areas, floors, and labels are views. Moving a device into Garage must not create a dependency or silently change importance. If a policy explicitly matches an area label, preview changed rule coverage. Do not offer “either dependency is sufficient” in v1: redundancy groups are reserved and rejected. Fallback automations can consume readiness without inventing redundancy semantics.

## 8. Checks and coverage must expose the quality of evidence

Each check detail should explain:

- What it establishes, and what it does not establish.
- Evidence source, last source timestamp, and adapter receipt time where available.
- Latest observation versus effective state after holds/expiry.
- Why it is unknown, waiting, or stale, and its next relevant deadline.
- Supported configuration, current values, catalog defaults, overrides, and reset action.
- Affected capability, dependent functions, and alert-policy consequences.

The catalog owns built-in check meaning. Threshold controls require defined parameters, units, and validation. User-authored rules can supply additional conditions through the reporting contract in section 14, without requiring a second general automation language inside Homeostatic. Advanced timing overrides should preview detection latency and survive catalog upgrades while showing changed recommendations.

Freshness needs particular care. An unchanged value can be healthy; repeated cached writes can be stale evidence. HA's [`last_reported`](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/03/20/state_reported_timestamp/) records state writes. The RFP requires proof that the observation reflects physical-device communication. Show “device freshness unavailable” when that proof is absent. Shortening `ttl` cannot create evidence.

A command check should show target, command time, deadline, and fresh resulting state. “No command outstanding” does not prove reachability. “Check again” requests a supported observation and reports when unavailable; it must not unexpectedly operate a door or lock.

Coverage should remain visible even when there are no open problems. Useful categories include active observation, awaiting first observation, stale/checker unavailable, unsupported, excluded, disabled at source, missing requirement, and partial coverage. These are adapter presentation categories, not new engine enums.

The planned `coverage()` query identifies no checks, never observed, and stale checks. Unsupported inventory and deliberate exclusions also need adapter data. Avoid a percentage that omits unsupported devices from its denominator. Prefer “42 discovered; 30 with supported monitoring; 7 unsupported; 5 excluded,” with capability gaps still available inside the 30.

Each gap should lead to an action: enable a supported check, restore a source, configure a probe, correct a mapping, or accept an uncovered requirement. Accepting the gap records a decision; it does not turn the requirement green.

## 9. Alerts must be explainable before and after delivery

### Recipients and transport

Start with static recipients, selected channels, quiet hours, and digests. Recipients need not be administrators. Enforce permissions for settings and notification actions in the backend, not just by hiding controls.

Choose explicit destinations. HA supports notify entities through `notify.send_message` as well as other notification actions; do not assume all targets are phone-specific service names. Generic `notify.notify` is unsuitable when destination must be predictable. See [HA notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify/).

For each channel, show target, availability, last test, and capabilities: ordinary/urgent delivery, replacement, clearing, and actionable responses. A missing channel is a configuration problem. Keep credentials in appropriate HA configuration and redact diagnostic exports.

`urgent` bypasses Homeostatic quiet hours; it does not prove a phone will sound through its own settings. Test transport behavior separately. Companion documentation describes [critical notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/critical-notifications/) and [replacement/clearing limitations](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic/#replacing). Do not promise silent replacement on transports that cannot support it.

“Whoever is home,” sites, absence, unknown presence, and fallback when nobody qualifies need defined semantics and fixtures. `PolicyContext` currently has no fields. Do not ship a presence selector that looks effective while routing statically.

### Editing and preview

Keep ADR 0010's YAML-first direction. A read-only explanation and preview can arrive before a complete visual editor. A later guided editor should use the same policy data with one authoritative configuration and lossless round trips for supported fields.

Offer a starting policy with concrete examples: maintenance in the morning digest, important operation failures immediately, ordinary failures according to quiet hours. It remains a replaceable proposal, not a universal household preference. Rules must expose order, matching fields, loudness, recipients/digest, reminders, and escalation.

For a lock with battery warning plus failed close command, preview each reason's first match and the urgent winning result. When the command clears, maintenance can remain without another noisy notification. Show that tied results use the earlier rule; recipients are not combined across losing rules (ADR 0020).

If a future “change alerts for this device” shortcut creates a policy rule, expose its scope and position. Do not create a hidden override system outside policy. Reordering needs before/after examples and warnings about plainly shadowed rules.

Separate **Preview policy** from **Send test notification**. Preview accepts time, sample reasons, importance, and supported context, and predicts delivery/reminder/escalation where calculable. Predictions depend on unchanged evidence and configuration. Use isolated state; never advance the live policy's counters to preview tomorrow.

Current escalation raises loudness one level; it is not an unlimited ladder or automatic reassignment to another person. Richer escalation needs policy work.

### Explain silence as well as alerts

Every problem should answer both “Why did this alert?” and “Why didn't this alert?” Show evidence, matched rules, winning reason, loudness, recipients, and delay/suppression with expiry. Distinguish:

- A check inside its raise hold.
- Settling while a dependency is in doubt.
- Symptoms recorded under another episode.
- Startup/rejoin grace or maintenance window.
- Record-only policy, digest, batch delay, or recipient quiet hours.
- Shelving until a specific time.
- Policy delivery requested but transport failed.

Policy output is not proof of delivery or reading. Track requested, accepted by channel, failed, and confirmed only where supported. Ordinary alerts may coalesce before sending; urgent messages already sent cannot be unsent when a late cause appears.

## 10. Everyday use and incident handling

The landing experience should prioritize blocked/degraded functions, actionable problems, maintenance due, and coverage gaps. A graph helps explain relationships but should not be the only way to navigate. “Requires” and “used by” lists must work on phones, with keyboards, and without color. Filter large inventories; avoid redrawing the entire topology for every observation.

A useful problem summary would read:

> Basement motion lighting is blocked. The Frigate host is unreachable. Four functions depend on it; three sensors also report failures. One problem is tracking the outage. A notification was requested for Michael at 02:40.

Problem detail needs first observation and opening times, evidence, confirmed versus suspected cause, potential impact versus observed symptoms, independent problems, delivery decisions/attempts, a short timeline, remedies, and scoped operator actions.

When siblings fail under a passing controller, say that several devices sharing the controller are failing and its own checks still pass. Coalescing suggests a shared cause; it does not prove controller failure. Explain remaining independent failures when a group dissolves.

Keep absorbed-episode links navigable with “merged into this problem.” Distinguish `removed`, `absorbed`, and `cleared`. Removing monitoring is not recovery. Explain clear holds and rejoin handling rather than show a stuck alert or premature all-clear.

Dismissing a phone notification must not clear the problem. “Fixed” must not fabricate a passing observation. Offer the actual remedy and supported recheck. Use HA [Repairs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/platform/repairs/) for actionable repair flows rather than duplicate every fault there. Automatic remediation remains outside the RFP's first version.

### Quiet controls need different names

| Action | Meaning | Still visible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Acknowledge this problem (planned) | Satisfy the episode's request for awareness; stop reminders and escalation waiting for acknowledgment | Active problem, evidence, health, impact, acknowledgment time and actor |
| Shelve this problem until a time | Hold policy deliveries for one episode | Evidence, health, impact, expiry |
| Start maintenance for a scope until a time | Prevent new episodes there | Observations, readiness, existing episodes |
| Set a recipient's quiet hours | Ordinary notifications wait; urgent bypasses the policy delay | Problems and other recipients' delivery state |
| Record only through policy | Keep problems without outbound messages | Evidence and history |
| Exclude a check | Stop monitoring that source | Coverage gap and effects on required functions |

Avoid one “mute” action covering all five. Shelving is episode-wide in the current API, not “silence only my phone.” Maintenance scope is one node, node plus dependents, or everything. Preview scope, show expiry, and make active windows/shelves easy to find after restart.

Maintenance does not silence already-open episodes. A combined action must show both the window and episodes being shelved. Quiet actions never make readiness healthy. Early cancellation of maintenance, window inspection, and durable acknowledgement (“I am handling this”) require API/semantic work. Do not disguise acknowledgement as shelving.

## 11. Configuration and lifecycle details that are easy to miss

Keep the eight starting settings in section 1, editable in an advanced surface. Recommend per-check overrides with precedence: explicit override, catalog value, then documented fallback where one exists. There is no invented universal `raise_hold` or `ttl`; missing required catalog values need correction. Explicit `ttl: None` does not disable unknown handling.

Preview a timeline for timing changes: last verified report -> expiry -> stale problem eligible -> policy delivery. Daily-reporting battery devices and frequently reporting detectors need different expectations. Display time zone with quiet hours/digests and test midnight/daylight-saving transitions. Current policy uses one zone, not one per recipient.

Validate references and values before applying; keep the last working configuration on failure. Bulk changes need an affected-item preview. Detect concurrent edits. Specify how changes affect open episodes and pending deliveries; blind reconstruction risks duplicates or lost continuity.

| Lifecycle event | UI requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Rename or move | Retain identity/settings; preview affected label-based rules |
| Unavailable | Distinguish loss of evidence from removal |
| Deliberately disabled | Explain coverage loss and affected functions |
| Removed | Expose broken references; retain history; removal is not recovery |
| Replaced | Review mapping of former role, checks, and dependencies |
| Catalog upgraded | Show changed assumptions, new checks, migrations, retained overrides |
| Restart | Restore episode identity and policy state; show grace and observation recovery |
| Restore failed | Explain continuity limits and actionable configuration/storage failure |
| Notification target lost | Show failure and offer remapping without claiming delivery |
| HA process died | Outside watchdog alerts independently of HA |

A watchdog page should distinguish configured, heartbeat sent, and externally verified, with verification time. Sending a heartbeat alone does not prove failure detection or delivery. Its test should not require taking the house down.

History is adapter work. Retain enough to explain last night's alert: findings, episode transitions, policy/configuration version, actions, and transport outcomes. Define retention and redacted export. A current snapshot is not a historical journal. If the UI loses its live connection, label displayed data stale.

During migration, inventory existing alerts the owner identifies, map supported equivalents, compare behavior, and keep unmatched items visible. A record-only trial can reduce duplicate outbound messages, but live activation still needs specified reconciliation. Never disable existing automations merely because a similar check exists.

Situation alerts are required in the intended Homeostatic product alongside health monitoring: water detected, door unlocked while away, and garage open at night. Their condition logic can come from existing automations while Homeostatic manages the problem and attention lifecycle. Preserve the distinction between an undesirable situation and failed equipment. Migrate an existing automation's notification responsibility only after verifying equivalent opening, update, and clearing behavior. Section 14 proposes the extension; the current library RFP still excludes situation alerts from its first version.

## 12. Implementation boundaries and missing contracts

This is a source-based planning inventory, not a claim about a released integration.

| UI need | Existing foundation | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explain failure/readiness | Public `explain` and `readiness` implementations | HA identities, presentation, proven observations |
| Impact, coverage, summaries | RFP specifies `impact`, `coverage`, `rollup` | Those public methods are absent from current `Engine`; settle/implement contracts |
| Current conditions and waiting times | Internal check, hold, gate, window, and episode state | Supported read model instead of private fields/snapshot internals |
| Policy explanation and preview | Per-reason decisions and delivery output | Supported decision trace and isolated preview |
| Static alerts/shelving | Current policy API | HA channels, tests, transport capabilities, authorization |
| Presence/sites | Recipient sites and empty `PolicyContext` | Context, fallback semantics, fixtures |
| Maintenance | `Engine.quiet` | Window identity/inspection and early-cancellation semantics if offered |
| Live configuration | Runtime registration/removal; immutable policy configuration | Validate/apply/reconcile open and pending state |
| Delivery activation/retry | Delivery intentions | Durable attempts, bounded retry, deduplication, truthful outcomes |
| Historical explanation | Current-state snapshots | Bounded journal and configuration versions in adapter |
| Replacement/catalog evolution | Adapter-chosen stable ids | Source mapping, provenance, migrations, broken references |
| User-created alerts and rule input | Generic observations, episodes, and attention policy | Condition registration/reporting, producer freshness, situation-alert semantics, RFP/ADR and fixtures |

The frontend must not reproduce readiness, inhibition, or policy algorithms. Engine/policy owns decisions; adapter owns discovery, mappings, history, delivery, and presentation data. New public read contracts may need an ADR.

Use native HA [options flows](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration/options_flow/) for ordinary settings, entities for function health, and actions for supported operations. A dedicated health view is recommended for reviewing many problems and coverage gaps; frontend technology and packaging are open. Assist can reuse read queries, with the same authorization/scope for any future mutation.

## 13. Recommended priorities and acceptance walkthroughs

These are recommendations for review, not accepted release assignments.

Section 16 records decisions for the first release that would replace the "First usable release" row below.

| Phase | Proposed scope |
| --- | --- |
| Prove inputs | Real detector, battery-freshness, and command-completion traces; demonstrate notification and watchdog paths |
| First usable release | Native setup; inventory/inclusion; catalog checks and advanced timing; functions/importance/dependencies; health/problem/coverage views; static recipients; YAML policy validation/explanation; channel test; shelving and bounded maintenance creation; restore/errors; user-defined alert registration and rule input after the required semantics are specified |
| Next | Guided policy editor with change preview; richer history; migration tools; saved readiness views; maintenance cancellation after API design; actionable phone controls |
| Later after semantics | Dynamic recipients/sites, acknowledgement/assignment, richer escalation, a general visual condition-expression builder, redundancy |

First-release hypothesis: with supported devices, an owner can enroll an integration, define one useful function, verify a channel, and understand coverage in about ten minutes without editing node definitions. Evaluate observed setup sessions; mandatory telemetry is unnecessary. Also measure duplicate messages per outage, unexplained decisions, time to locate a cause, and persistent evidence gaps.

The following are proposed integration/UI walkthroughs, not new numbered library stories or executable fixtures. Existing story/scenario ids remain unchanged.

| Walkthrough | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Enroll two instances of one integration | Separate identity, checks, device selection |
| Discover a new device | Visible inclusion setting applies; exclusions persist; unsupported coverage is visible |
| Function has passing and unwatched required branches | Cannot appear fully ready; missing evidence is explained |
| Frigate host fails | One problem explains symptoms and function impact without rewriting own status |
| Detection hangs while recording works | Motion readiness changes independently of recording |
| Recording disk fills while detection works | Motion lighting is not blocked by the recording capability |
| Lock battery warns and command fails | Per-reason preview explains urgent winner and later maintenance-only state |
| Several devices fail under passing controller | Shared-cause suspicion without claiming controller failure |
| Start maintenance on failing controller | Existing problems remain unless shelved; readiness stays truthful |
| Shelve and restart | Problem/expiry survive; restored policy controls delivery |
| Reorder maintenance rule | Preview shows changed outcomes and recipients |
| Cached writes continue after device disconnect | Never claim verified physical freshness |
| Remove required device | Explicit unresolved requirement, not apparent function recovery |
| Transport fails | Decision and failed attempt separate; no delivered claim |
| Recover before batch delivery | No stale opening sent; history remains understandable |
| Restart after delivery | Stable episode identity; no new page just for restarting |
| Migrate garage-open-at-night alert | Preserve condition semantics while moving its problem/notification lifecycle into Homeostatic through the specified rule interface |
| UI connection drops | Old all-clear is visibly stale |

Observation-proof walkthroughs need real traces under RFP section 11. Synthetic engine fixtures do not prove HA can produce that evidence.

The next decisions are enrollment defaults for future devices, first supported external probes, activation of already-open problems, treatment of excluded requirements, provenance/overrides of automatic edges, and the minimum read/decision APIs. Importance editing and advanced timing overrides are recommended for the first usable UI; a complete visual policy editor can follow YAML.

The product test is one understandable chain: **this part of the house matters -> these capabilities support it -> these checks provide evidence -> this problem explains failure -> this policy explains who heard -> this action helps address it**.

## 14. User-created alerts and rules as inputs

**Owner requirement:** create alerts such as “the front door has been open for three hours and it is 2 a.m.,” alongside remote-system failure, disk capacity, and other custom conditions. This belongs in the product scope. The design recommendation is to separate **detecting a condition** from **managing a problem and delivering attention**.

The current RFP explicitly excludes situation alerts from the library's first version. Supporting them requires an explicit scope/model proposal and fixtures before implementation; this worksheet does not silently change that contract. Remote host/service failure and disk capacity already fit health monitoring. A healthy door sensor reporting an open door is a situation, not a broken sensor.

### One alert lifecycle, several sources

| Source | Responsibility | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Built-in catalog check | Interpret supported device/service evidence | Remote host unreachable, detector stalled, disk nearly full |
| Simple user-created condition | Evaluate a supported state/duration/threshold pattern | Door open too long during specified hours |
| Existing HA automation, template, or other rule producer | Evaluate custom logic and report current condition | Windows open while heating, abnormal freezer temperature, missed scheduled job |

All sources should use shared problem identity, evidence, history, notification policy, reminders, shelving, and recovery handling. The producer should not need to reproduce recipients, quiet hours, repeated notifications, or escalation logic. Use different names for **condition rules**, which establish a problem, and **notification rules**, which decide who hears about it.

Prefer a HA action for registered rule producers to report a condition, plus an optional binding to a stateful entity that Homeostatic can evaluate on setup/restart. Exact action names and arguments are not yet an API. Do not accept arbitrary prebuilt engine events or let an automation fabricate episode identities; the problem owner manages those.

### Create alert: simple form and advanced rule entry

The UI should offer common patterns first: state persists too long, measurement crosses a threshold, heartbeat is missing, expected result/deadline is missed, or an existing entity represents a problem. An advanced path lets an existing automation report the condition through the same lifecycle.

For the door example, an illustrative form would say:

| Field | Example choice |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Front door open overnight |
| Source | Front door contact sensor |
| Problem condition | Open continuously for at least three hours |
| When it applies | Between 22:00 and 07:00 in the home's time zone |
| Condition ends | Verified closed, or the overnight rule no longer applies |
| Importance | Owner-selected consequence, such as high |
| Attention | Preview the notification rule; optionally create an explicit urgent exception |
| Missing evidence | Unknown, with source-health/freshness monitoring; never assume closed |

Those hours and importance are examples, not inferred preferences or defaults. If the intent is instead “check specifically at 02:00,” the form must express that different schedule. High importance alone does not guarantee an urgent delivery.

Trigger reevaluation when the door changes, the three-hour threshold arrives, the time window opens/closes, configuration changes, and HA restarts. A door open since 18:00 must qualify when the overnight window begins, even without another sensor transition. A door opened at 23:00 qualifies at 02:00. Do not restart the open-duration clock at bedtime unless explicitly requested.

The rule's clear semantics must also be explicit. At 07:00, “overnight condition no longer applies” does not mean “door closed.” Owners may instead choose to keep a raised problem active until verified closure, but that latching behavior needs a specified lifecycle. Disabling/deleting a rule is administrative removal, not observed recovery.

### Rules report state, not a stream of new messages

A proposed reporting contract needs:

| Information | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Stable definition/condition key and subject | Repeated evaluations update one active occurrence; two doors remain independent |
| Producer identity and authorized ownership | One rule cannot accidentally clear a different rule's problem |
| Active, clear, or unknown result | Lack of evidence is distinct from verified recovery; these are adapter concepts, not new core enums |
| Occurrence start and observation time | Duration of the condition is distinct from episode opening and message delivery |
| Reason, measured evidence, and readable message | Explain the condition and show what changed |
| Importance and routing labels on the registered definition | Keep policy configurable and reports scoped to their intended meaning |
| Freshness/renewal contract | Detect a producer that stopped reporting without falsely clearing its problem |
| Clear semantics and optional clear hold | Define what ends this condition, including hysteresis for numeric thresholds |

Repeated active reports should update the same occurrence. Verified clearing ends it; a later recurrence starts a new one. Reject or ignore stale/out-of-order reports under a documented ordering rule. Deduplicate retries. An unknown report or expired producer lease must not become a clear, and lost evidence must not erase a previously active condition from the UI.

Separate an externally monitored heartbeat from the health of the monitoring producer. “Remote service missed its heartbeat” can be a problem even when the remote service cannot report its own death. “The checker stopped running” is unknown coverage, not proof the remote service died. `ttl` alone expresses expired evidence; the catalog/producer must decide whether a missed expected heartbeat establishes failure or only uncertainty.

Stateful bindings are useful because current truth can be reconciled after restart. Action-only producers must define how they report initial state, renew evidence, and clear. Persist verified condition start times/deadlines when needed. Do not claim uninterrupted physical state during an observation gap without evidence. HA documents that automation `for` waits reset on restart/reload, so a naive three-hour wait is insufficient for continuity. See [automation trigger timing](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#template-trigger).

For thresholds, define units, missing-value handling, and distinct raise/clear criteria where appropriate. A disk might warn above a chosen utilization and clear below a lower threshold; an absent measurement must not be converted to zero usage. Assign each duration to one layer so producer timing and engine holds do not accidentally double the delay.

### Share attention without inventing health dependencies

A situation's subject and evidence source are associations, not automatically cause edges. Losing a door sensor must not suppress or clear an already-known open-door situation. An open-door situation must not make the contact sensor or unrelated door functions appear broken. A shared area or source does not justify coalescing two independent situations.

The first implementation option to evaluate is a separately registered condition node/check, isolated from equipment dependency inhibition and unrelated function readiness, while reusing episode and policy mechanics. Kind/category names can remain open strings. This is a proposed use of the model: it needs RFP/ADR review against the one-capability rule, unknown handling, and quiet-window scope. Do not silently label the physical device failed just to obtain a notification.

If the condition lifecycle cannot fit the engine without distorting those rules, use a dedicated condition-to-episode adapter that feeds the shared attention policy. That adapter would own identity, opening/update/resolution, restore, and unknown semantics explicitly; it should not become a second notification engine. Choose between these implementations with the walkthroughs below, rather than exposing either internal model in the alert form.

Global maintenance scope deserves a deliberate decision when situations are included: maintenance for a controller or host should not accidentally suppress a door-open situation merely because it uses that device's evidence. Shared recipients and policy do not imply shared suppression scope.

### Other useful alert patterns

| Pattern | Example | Evidence/clear requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State persists | Door open too long; water flowing too long | Verified duration and explicit end condition |
| Threshold | Freezer warm; disk nearly full; UPS battery low | Valid units, current samples, suitable clear threshold/hold |
| Missing heartbeat | Remote service silent; scheduled telemetry missing | Independent observer and expected reporting interval |
| Deadline missed | Backup/job did not finish; expected device did not reconnect | Known schedule/command and evidence of completion |
| End-to-end failure | Host responds but remote inference or recording fails | Probe the required service, not only the host |
| Combined condition | Heating with windows open; unlocked while away | Defined behavior for unknown source/presence and condition transitions |
| Growing risk | Storage expected to fill soon | Producer-supplied projection/deadline; no invented core prediction |

HA already has an [Alert integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/alert/) for repeating alerts and acknowledgement. Existing setups are migration candidates, not a reason to create duplicate notification loops. Homeostatic's proposed value is shared health context, episode handling, policy, evidence, and explanation. Preserve an existing alert until its replacement's opening, reminder, clear, and acknowledgement differences have been reviewed; acknowledgement is still a separate open design item here.

### Required walkthroughs before implementing the extension

- Door opens at 23:00: one problem becomes eligible at 02:00; repeated evaluations do not create repeated openings.
- Door already exceeded three hours before the overnight window starts: it is evaluated at window start.
- HA restarts near the deadline: reconcile persisted evidence and current state; do not claim continuity that was not observed.
- Door source becomes unavailable: show unknown evidence and preserve the unresolved situation without declaring closure.
- Schedule ends while door remains open: follow the selected semantics and never say the door physically closed.
- Two doors match one reusable rule: independent keys, clear actions, and histories.
- A delayed active report arrives after verified clearing: it cannot resurrect the old occurrence.
- Remote service dies while the reporting adapter stays healthy: the independent observer raises the expected problem.
- Reporting adapter dies: expose freshness/coverage loss rather than invent remote failure or recovery.
- Disk readings oscillate near a threshold: use the defined hysteresis/holds without notification storms.
- A condition producer is disabled or removed: expose lost coverage/administrative removal rather than a false all-clear.
- Controller maintenance starts during an open-door situation: suppression follows explicit situation scope, not an accidental source association.

The minimum product path is **register a user alert -> bind a condition source or report from a rule -> preview shared policy -> manage one ongoing problem**. A sophisticated expression editor can come later; user-defined alerts should not depend on building one.

## 15. Follow Home Assistant's existing error and repair patterns

**Owner requirement:** follow and reuse HA's design patterns for integration and device errors. Verified 2026-09-24 against current official documentation, Core release `2026.9.3`, and frontend release `20260826.7`. These release sources establish the baseline; this is not an inspection of the owner's running HA instance. The local `C:/GitHub/core` checkout identifies itself as `2025.11.0.dev0`, so it was not used as the current reference.

### Existing surfaces and their intended meaning

| Situation | HA's existing mechanism | Homeostatic's proposed use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration cannot finish setup | Config-entry states distinguish retry, setup error, migration error, and other lifecycle states; retry can recover automatically | Preserve the native state/reason, apply catalog timing, show function impact, link to the original entry |
| Credentials expired | Reauthentication flow; current Core also creates a related repair issue | Point to that flow and correlate the existing issue instead of creating another login form or duplicate issue |
| Entity cannot be read/controlled | Entity availability; missing values can instead be unknown | Retain the source distinction and evaluate the particular capability; do not mark a whole device failed indiscriminately |
| Integration exposes a specific fault | Problem-class binary sensor or other integration-provided diagnostic entity | Reuse the structured signal and its documented meaning |
| User intervention is required | Repairs issue with explanation and supported fix/help path | Reuse an existing issue; create our own only when Homeostatic owns an actionable problem |
| An action fails | Validation/runtime exception returned to the action caller | Return a useful translated error for our actions; separately track persistent failure where warranted |
| Troubleshooting needs detail | Integration logs, debug logging, diagnostics when supported | Link to these tools and offer redacted Homeostatic evidence |

The [config-entry lifecycle](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/config_entries_index/) and [setup-failure guidance](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/integration_setup_failures/) distinguish recoverable setup delay from failure. The [released integration row](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/blob/20260826.7/src/panels/config/integrations/ha-config-entry-row.ts) renders a status icon, localized state, explanatory reason, and context-dependent actions including logs, reload, reconfigure, and diagnostics. Follow this pattern of a specific problem plus a useful next action.

HA's [availability guidance](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/entity-unavailable/) distinguishes inability to fetch from a temporarily missing value. The catalog must interpret those signals: unavailable can establish failure of an HA control path without proving physical hardware is dead. An integration being loaded likewise does not establish that every device or service operation works. Avoid parsing log text as the primary source of structured health.

A [problem binary sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class) represents a detected problem, while [entity categories](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#registry-properties) distinguish configuration and diagnostics. Use standard entities, device classes, names, and categories where the meaning fits. A readiness entity must remain available to report “blocked”; its own availability indicates whether Homeostatic can supply that answer. Do not compress ready/degraded/blocked/unknown into a misleading boolean without retaining those distinctions.

### Repairs are an actionable surface, not every notification

HA's [repair quality rule](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/repair-issues/) requires useful information and a problem the user can address. This includes more than configuration migrations: low disk space is explicitly an example in the [repair lifecycle documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/platform/repairs/). A remote outage without a meaningful repair action need not become another Repairs entry.

Keep the native issue identity, owning integration, severity, and ignored state. Link a Homeostatic problem to it. Do not delete another integration's issue or manufacture passing evidence when its repair flow finishes. Native dismissal/ignore and temporary Homeostatic shelving are different operations; their notification interaction must be explicit.

For an issue we own, use a stable issue id, translated explanation, and the appropriate fix flow or help link. Account for HA's persistence and ignore lifecycle rather than re-creating issues on every evaluation. Native repair severity is separate from health status, function importance, and delivery loudness. In particular, HA reserves its critical repair severity for exceptional panic conditions; it is not an automatic mapping from a critical function.

Current Core's [reauthentication implementation](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/2026.9.3/homeassistant/config_entries.py#L1336) supplies a concrete example of reuse: the config entry, active flow, and repair issue are manifestations of one credential problem. Correlate them using structured source identity, not matching English messages. Source-specific adapters may be required because there is not a universal foreign issue-to-device association to assume.

### Native setup, actions, and presentation

Use config/options/reconfigure flows for their existing purposes. Preserve original device and integration identities and link back to their pages. Expose our rule-reporting actions through HA's ordinary action mechanism with suitable selectors and translated field/error text. HA's [action failure rule](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/action-exceptions/) distinguishes invalid input from execution failure; a failed request must not appear saved successfully.

The [released device page](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/blob/20260826.7/src/panels/config/devices/ha-config-device-page.ts) groups entities into ordinary controls, sensors, configuration, and diagnostics, with supported diagnostic downloads. Follow those familiar groupings. A dedicated Homeostatic view adds cross-device episodes, dependency explanations, coverage, and policy decisions. It should share HA's terminology, theme, responsive behavior, and accessibility patterns. Inspecting frontend source establishes design precedent, not a guarantee that private frontend components are supported extension APIs.

Use existing HA notification transports for outbound delivery. A [persistent notification](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/persistent_notification/) is an in-app message that can be updated or dismissed; it is neither a repair workflow nor proof of physical recovery. Avoid putting the same episode into Repairs, a persistent notification, and a phone alert by default without a defined purpose for each. Our policy controls our deliveries; it does not silently disable another integration's notifications.

Respect HA's [log-on-transition guidance](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/rules/log-when-unavailable/) for adapter connectivity, rather than logging every retry as a new error. The health-tree library retains its own no-I/O and DEBUG-only logging boundary.

### Concrete acceptance checks

- Expired credentials produce one correlated Homeostatic problem with a working path to native reauthentication, preserving HA's existing issue ownership.
- Temporary setup retry remains visibly different from permanent setup failure and expected startup/disabled state.
- One unavailable diagnostic entity does not automatically fail every capability of its device.
- A loaded integration with a failed end-to-end check can still produce a service-health problem.
- Native repair ignore is displayed accurately and is not treated as repair, recovery, or automatic shelving.
- A low-disk repair already raised by HA is linked rather than duplicated.
- Homeostatic cannot provide fresh readiness: its exported entity reports that limitation, rather than retaining a false current all-clear.
- A bad rule-reporting action returns the native style of actionable validation error and leaves the prior configuration intact.

The practical design rule is: **retain HA's original state and correction path; add cause, consequences, episode history, coverage, and attention decisions around it.** Changes to library semantics still require the RFP and fixtures; this section establishes integration and UI direction.

## 16. The first release: decisions and scope

Proposed 2026-09-25. Michael answered the decision table the same day; his answers are recorded below, and all twelve are settled. Answer 1 contradicted RFP 0.5 section 2. RFP 0.6 and ADRs 0031 and 0032 are accepted, so situation alerts are library behavior. The rest of this section is still direction for the integration. If this section is accepted, it replaces the "First usable release" row in section 13 and closes the matching items in "Still to argue" and in section 13's next decisions.

Why this section exists: section 13's first release contains nearly every surface in this worksheet, which contradicts its own ten-minute setup hypothesis. This section keeps what makes the nine stories in RFP section 9 visible and explainable, and settles the model questions that would be expensive to change later.

### Decision 1: situation alerts are in, but HA rules detect them

Situation alerts ship in the first release. Homeostatic does not detect them. An HA rule does: a template, a problem-class binary sensor, or an automation that maintains such an entity. Homeostatic manages the problem from there: identity, episode, policy, reminders, shelving, and explanation.

This drops two things from section 14:

- The simple "create alert" form, with its state, duration, schedule, and threshold patterns.
- Action-only reporting from automations, with producer leases and ordering rules.

What remains is a binding from a named alert to one HA entity:

| Entity state | Homeostatic reads it as |
| --- | --- |
| `on` | Active |
| `off` | Clear |
| `unavailable` or `unknown` | Unknown: never clear, and the problem stays open |

Consequences:

- The rule owns the condition, its timing, and its schedule. "Open three hours and it is 2 a.m." lives in the template. HA's own restart behavior for `for` and `delay_on` belongs to that rule, not to Homeostatic. The alert detail must say so plainly, not imply continuity Homeostatic did not observe.
- A stateful entity survives a restart. Homeostatic reconciles from current state and needs no lease or replay logic.
- Situation nodes stay outside the cause graph. They are not inhibited by equipment failures, they do not affect readiness, and they are not coalesced by shared area or source (section 14, "Share attention").
- Equipment maintenance never suppresses a situation. Situations follow only their own explicit quiet scope.
- The rest of section 14's walkthroughs reduce to the ones about unknown handling, two doors under one rule, restart reconciliation, and maintenance scope.

### Decision 2: one rule model for checks, special cases, and exclusions

The catalog assigns checks through rules that match node attributes, as in Icinga apply rules. There is no separate per-entity override system. A special case is a rule with a narrow match.

- **Match fields, from the start:** domain, `device_class`, integration (config entry), device, entity, area, floor, and label. Matching keys on stable source ids, never display names or `entity_id` strings (section 6).
- **Actions:** attach checks with their parameters, or exclude. Exclusion covers a whole integration, a device, or one check, and so replaces the three-level inherit/include/exclude tree in section 6.
- **Evaluation:** attach rules are additive, and an exclude always wins over an attach, whatever their order. That makes the result independent of rule order. Otherwise rule order would carry meaning twice: once here and again in the policy, where it already does.
- **Area and label match now.** A preview before a move was the reason to wait, and it isn't possible anyway, because devices are moved in HA's own UI, not in Homeostatic. So Homeostatic reports afterwards: when a reconcile changes a node's checks, it records "checks changed because this device moved to Garage", and the change appears in the device's recent history.
- Every check shows which rule attached it. Every exclusion shows which rule excluded it. That is `explain` for the configuration.
- An excluded capability that a monitored function requires stays an explicit, unwatched requirement (section 6). Exclusion never makes readiness green.
- Health signal for the configuration itself: many single-entity rules mean a broader rule is missing.

The shipped rule pack is the default configuration. The owner adds, edits, and disables rules. A live "matches N nodes" preview while editing a rule is part of doing this correctly the first time, because the owner is editing a rule in Homeostatic there and a preview is possible.

### Decision 3: enrollment is an integration setting

The default belongs in the integration's config and options flow, like any HA integration setting:

- Watch everything the rule pack supports, with passive checks only. Active probes start only when a rule that names them is enabled.
- Future devices inherit, because rules match them automatically.
- Notifications are off until the owner activates them in the flow.

### Decision 4: no per-check timing overrides

Catalog values per check, plus the eight house settings in section 1. A wrong value is a catalog bug. Revisit after real traces.

### Decision 5: importance is editable on functions

Required in the first release. Without it the policy cannot tell the garage from backyard music.

### Decision 6: Homeostatic manages notification information; consumers deliver it

Michael's direction: Homeostatic manages what there is to say and when. Consumers decide how it reaches people. This removes transport binding from the integration: no notify-service mapping, channel tests, or per-transport capability handling (section 9, "Recipients and transport").

Proposed boundary:

| Homeostatic owns | Consumers own |
| --- | --- |
| The problem: episode identity, cause, impact, evidence, remedy | Which device, app, or service carries the message |
| Loudness: `record`, `digest`, `notify`, `urgent` | Formatting, critical or time-sensitive push, TTS, sound |
| Timing: batching, quiet hours, digests, reminders, escalation | Mapping a recipient id to real people or devices |
| The message content, led by the function | Replacing or clearing a phone notification by tag |

Timing stays in Homeostatic because it needs episode state that an automation does not have. A reminder after two hours, a digest at 07:00, or holding an update because the episode already paged: all of these would otherwise be rebuilt, badly, in every consumer. This keeps ADR 0010: the attention policy stays in the library, with opaque recipient and channel ids, and the policy is edited as YAML only.

Acknowledgment extends this boundary (accepted design, implementation pending): [ADR 0033](../adr/0033-acknowledgment-belongs-to-attention-policy.md) and RFP section 7 place its meaning and state in the library policy. Consumers return an explicit acknowledgment request through Homeostatic; the adapter authorizes it and persists the result. One acknowledgment satisfies the episode across channels and recipients. It does not clear the problem, schedule a check-in, or execute a corrective action. Users configure their own corrective automations. Current attention state must remain queryable after missed events, so consumers do not become separate owners of acknowledgment or escalation. Detailed interaction questions remain in RFP section 13.

Output: one HA event per delivery, for example `homeostatic_notification`, carrying:

- the episode id, usable as a notification tag
- the action: open, update, remind, escalate, resolve, or digest
- loudness and recipient id
- title, message, function, cause, and a link to the problem

The same information stays readable from entities and the problem view. The integration ships a blueprint that sends these events to the companion app: the episode id as the tag, critical for `urgent`, and a clear on resolve. That makes the default setup work without the owner writing an automation, while anyone can route events elsewhere.

Consequences:

- Delivery outcomes are unknown to Homeostatic. The problem view can say "delivery requested at 02:40", never "delivered" or "read" (section 9 already requires this distinction).
- A missing consumer is silent failure. Setup must verify that at least one automation handles the event, and coverage reports "no consumer for `urgent`" as a gap.
- The watchdog's alert path cannot be an HA automation, because HA may be the thing that died (section 11).

### Decision 7: activation sends one summary

When notifications are activated with problems already open, send one summary of what is open, then deliver live. Never replay individual openings. Reminder and escalation clocks start at activation. This needs an integration scenario.

### Decision 8: edges are confirmed per function

Candidate edges from automations are suggested while defining a function. There is no global queue. Automations outside any function contribute no edges.

### What the first release contains

| Area | In the first release | Later |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enrollment | Config and options flow; watch all supported, passively; notifications off until activated | |
| Rules | Shipped pack; add, edit, disable; all match fields; include and exclude; live match preview; rule provenance on every check | |
| Timing | Eight house settings; catalog values per check | Per-check overrides |
| Functions | Name, importance, required capabilities; per-function edge suggestions; declared external edges | |
| Situation alerts | Bind a named alert to an HA entity | A native condition builder: not planned |
| Views | Blocked functions, open problems, maintenance due, coverage as counts | Saved readiness views |
| Problem detail | Cause, affected functions, evidence, remedy, who heard and why, why not | Full decision trace |
| Entities | One readiness entity per function: ready, degraded, blocked, unknown | |
| Repairs | Link HA's own issues; create ours only when the owner can act | |
| Policy | YAML with opaque recipient ids, validated, read-only explanation | Guided editor, if ever |
| Delivery | `homeostatic_notification` events; a shipped companion-app blueprint; a coverage gap when no consumer handles `urgent` | Presence and sites |
| Quiet controls | Shelve until a time; maintenance with an expiry | Early cancellation, acknowledgement |
| Watchdog | Configured, heartbeat sent, externally verified | |
| Continuity | Snapshot and restore; recently resolved problems; stale label on lost connection | Full history journal and export |

### The notification is the primary screen

Most of the owner's contact with Homeostatic is a message on a phone. Design it before the panel.

- Lead with the function, then the cause: "Basement motion lighting is blocked. The Frigate host is unreachable."
- Add one line of consequence: "4 functions affected."
- Tapping opens that problem, not the landing screen.
- Every event carries the episode id, so the blueprint replaces the earlier message where the transport supports tags. Otherwise updates are labeled as updates and never re-announce the problem.
- A resolution notice names what recovered and what is still open.
- A situation alert reads as a situation, not a failure: "Front door open since 23:04."
- The maintenance digest is one message grouped by action, such as "Replace batteries: 3".

Acceptance: write each of the nine stories, plus one situation alert, as the exact phone text from opening to resolution. Review those texts before panel work starts.

### Glance, detail, advanced

| Layer | Where | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glance | Landing screen, notification | Function or alert, state, cause, since when, next action |
| Detail | One tap | Evidence, affected functions, who heard and why, remedy, shelve and maintenance |
| Advanced | Expanded on request | Holds and deadlines, raw observations, timestamps, rule trace, absorbed members, edge and rule provenance |

Nothing in the advanced layer may be needed to answer "what is broken, and what do I do?"

### Library and RFP work that comes first

1. ~~An RFP change and ADR for decision 1.~~ Accepted: RFP 0.6, ADRs 0031 and 0032, story 10, and scenarios 61 to 64, all passing against the current engine.
2. An ADR for a supported read model (section 12).
3. ~~The `impact`, `coverage`, and `rollup` queries.~~ Done: merged in PR #4 (ADR 0029).
4. Stable source ids, with rules and declared edges stored as introspectable data.
5. The observation proofs from real traces.

### Decisions

| # | Decision | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Situation alerts in the first release | Yes, detected only by HA rules bound as entities. RFP 0.6, ADRs 0031 and 0032 (accepted) |
| 2 | Catalog as attribute-matching rules | Yes. Special cases are narrow rules |
| 3 | Rule match fields | All of them, now. Report changes after moves |
| 4 | Enrollment default | Integration config: watch all supported, passive, notifications off until activated |
| 5 | Exclusion granularity | Full, from the start, as exclude rules |
| 6 | Per-check timing overrides | Not in the first release |
| 7 | Importance editing | First release, on functions |
| 8 | Notifications | Homeostatic owns content, loudness, and timing; consumers deliver through an HA event and a shipped blueprint. Policy is YAML only |
| 9 | Activation with open problems | One summary, then live delivery |
| 10 | Candidate edges | Per function, no global queue |
| 11 | Rule evaluation | Attach is additive; exclude always wins; order does not matter |
| 12 | Maintenance and situations | Equipment maintenance never suppresses a situation |

Next, mark the matching rows in sections 1 to 3 **v1** or **later**, and close the items in "Still to argue".

## 17. Dashboard and optional TopoMation connection

Agreed with Michael on 2026-09-25. This section records product direction for implementation, not shipped functionality. It extends section 16's notification-first, glance/detail/advanced approach. Delivery status lives in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

### Questions the UI must answer

| Owner question | Information to present |
| --- | --- |
| Is anything wrong that matters? | Open problems and active situations, prioritized by consequence and importance |
| What is affected? | Affected functions and capabilities, with the shared cause explained |
| What should I do? | A useful next action where known, supporting evidence, and the relevant HA page or Repair link |
| What is happening in this part of my house? | Location views combining functions, problems, situations, and monitoring coverage |
| How much can I trust this picture? | What is watched, excluded, missing, or awaiting evidence, and what each check establishes |
| What changed? | Enrollment, rule/exclusion changes, lost evidence, and recoveries, with available history clearly bounded |
| Will someone be told? | Notification configuration, pending/requested notifications, and the reason for silence; never infer phone receipt |

### Dashboard and problem detail

Provide an automatically populated Homeostatic dashboard and reusable cards for existing HA dashboards. Needs attention and Home functions lead the overview. Browse the house is the main exploration path, Coverage remains visible, and Recent changes sits further down. Preserve the planned maintenance presentation as the relevant evidence and controls arrive.

- **Needs attention:** show root problems with their affected functions, and active situations in language appropriate to the situation. Shared causes group their symptoms; a door left open is not described as failed equipment.
- **Home functions:** show owner-defined functions with ready, degraded, blocked, or unknown readiness. Their definition and required capabilities remain explicit.
- **Browse the house:** start with the native HA floor-to-area hierarchy, including distinct groups for areas without a floor and sources without an area, and allow browsing by integration. A location detail brings together its functions, problems, situations, and coverage. Cross-location causes and consequences remain reachable.
- **Coverage:** distinguish unavailable evidence and unsupported checks from passing observations. No open problems does not establish complete monitoring. Availability alone does not prove physical freshness or successful command completion.
- **Recent changes:** explain arrivals, enrollment changes, exclusions, missing evidence, and recoveries. The current enrollment log contains only the last 50 changes in the current runtime; recently resolved problem history is still planned.

A problem's glance view shows the function or situation, state, cause where known, since when, and next action. One tap opens that problem's evidence, affected functions, remedy, and attention explanation. Holds, raw observations, timestamps, and rule/edge provenance belong in an optional advanced layer. Notification and dashboard wording should agree, and notification links should open the same problem directly. Add shelving and maintenance controls as their backend contracts land.

Keep observed condition, function readiness, and notification state distinct. Shelving or quiet delivery must not make a failing capability appear healthy. A disconnected dashboard must identify stale information rather than continue presenting it as current.

### Automatic population follows enrollment

The integration's catalog and configuration remain the source of monitoring decisions. The dashboard renders those decisions and public query results; it does not implement a second health engine or enrollment model.

- New eligible sources appear automatically when enrolled by matching rules. Show why checks attached and which rule excluded a source.
- Area/floor changes update grouping. Where a move also changes catalog-rule matches, explain the resulting enrollment change separately from the grouping change.
- Missing monitored sources remain visibly unknown until deliberately removed from scope. Disappearance is not recovery.
- Preserve stable source identity across supported renames and use current display names.
- Discover locations and inventory automatically. Named functions and their hard requirements need owner definition or confirmation; an automation reference alone does not establish a dependency.

### Optional TopoMation connection

Homeostatic must work without TopoMation. When available, TopoMation can enrich house browsing with its property, building, grounds, floor, room, and subarea hierarchy. This is optional integration work, not a prerequisite for the first useful dashboard or a dependency of the health-tree library.

Stage the connection:

1. **House navigation:** read the richer location structure and source mappings. Fall back to HA areas and floors when TopoMation is absent or unavailable.
2. **Location context:** optionally show relevant occupancy and managed automations, identified as TopoMation information with its availability made clear.
3. **Function suggestions later:** use automation configuration to propose functions and requirements for per-function review. Suggestions must not silently create hard dependencies.

Location membership creates presentation groups only. It never creates causal edges, suppresses alerts, changes importance, or establishes readiness. This follows health-tree ADRs 0006 and 0029. A device being inside a garage does not make it depend on a garage node.

TopoMation can combine several occupancy sources so that any source can establish occupancy. Importing every sensor as a mandatory dependency would incorrectly block a function when one sensor fails. Alternative sources and fallback behavior must be understood before proposing requirements; the current hard-dependency model must not pretend to represent redundancy it does not support.

Losing TopoMation must not stop Homeostatic monitoring or erase problems. Only the added navigation/context should fall back or become explicitly unavailable. Define the read interface, stable-id mapping, and refresh behavior before implementing the connection; do not couple Homeostatic to TopoMation's private runtime or storage.

### Next design work and acceptance walkthroughs

Review the story notification texts specified in section 16, then design the overview and one complete problem-detail screen using normal operation, a shared dependency failure, and a newly enrolled source with incomplete evidence. HA custom dashboard strategies plus live Homeostatic cards are the implementation candidate; frontend transport, resource registration, and layout details still need a concrete design.

The implementation should demonstrate these walkthroughs with executable scenarios and appropriate frontend checks:

- A new source enrolls and becomes visible without editing dashboard entity lists; its attachment rule is inspectable.
- A shared controller failure appears as one cause with affected functions and symptoms visible in detail.
- A location move updates browsing; any rule-driven monitoring change has its own explanation and does not invent a dependency.
- An excluded requirement or missing source stays visibly unknown rather than making the function ready.
- A situation remains visible independently of equipment failures and equipment maintenance.
- With TopoMation absent, the dashboard remains useful through HA areas/floors. With it present, the richer hierarchy is available. Losing it preserves monitoring and problem identity.
- An optional occupancy source is never silently converted into a required edge by an imported suggestion.
- Dashboard disconnect/reconnect, notification silence, and unavailable history are represented honestly.

## 18. First dashboard and notification design review

Draft for owner review, 2026-09-25. The interactive prototype uses synthetic data; no live HA connection or notification transport is involved. It explores normal operation, a shared Frigate integration failure affecting four functions, and a newly enrolled sensor awaiting evidence. Overview, problem detail, function detail, location browsing, coverage, and phone-message previews are interactive. Optional design controls explore TopoMation navigation/fallback, row spacing, and a lost frontend connection. This is presentation work, not an implemented dashboard or approved final copy.

### Findings to preserve in implementation

- Distinguish the observed Frigate integration setup error from a host failure. The first availability-backed dashboard can report the former; a host-unreachable claim requires a host probe.
- A newly enrolled sensor can make a declared function unknown before any problem opens. Enrollment and adding that sensor as a function requirement are separate decisions.
- An alert activation timestamp does not establish when the underlying physical condition began. The bound on/off situation entity alone cannot supply the door-open time in story 10.
- Recovery copy must reflect current requirements. A recovered root does not automatically establish that every affected function is ready.
- Current enrollment changes are bounded to the last 50 changes in the runtime; the proposed combined activity/recovery timeline still needs its read and persistence contract.
- Delivery-request timestamps and routing are visible; receipt remains unverified.

### Proposed story messages

These drafts follow health-tree RFP section 9, stories 1 through 10. The story timing and routes require their stated policies and evidence producers; they are not promises about the default integration. Updates below are text to use when a request is due, not instructions to send on every observation. Labels explicitly marked silent or no request describe lifecycle behavior rather than new phone messages. Recovery examples assume their stated evidence has been confirmed. All text is DRAFT - NOT SENT.

#### Story 1: Frigate host dies

Requires host reachability evidence. Timing follows the story’s configured policy, not the shipped default.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening · 02:40 | **Motion lighting is blocked in four rooms.** The Frigate host is unreachable. Check the host and its network connection. |
| Update · same problem | **Motion lighting remains blocked in four rooms.** The Frigate integration and person sensors are unavailable under the same host problem. |
| Recovery · after confirmed recovery | **Motion lighting is ready again in four rooms.** The Frigate host and required checks have recovered. |

Use one problem link and message identity through updates. Recovery wording assumes all four functions are confirmed ready.

#### Story 2: Detector hangs

Requires detector-progress evidence. Available entities alone cannot establish this failure.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening | **Motion lighting is blocked in four rooms.** Frigate’s detector has stopped making progress, although its person sensors still report clear. Check the detector. |
| Update | **Motion lighting remains blocked in four rooms.** The detector has not resumed progress. |
| Recovery · after confirmed recovery | **Motion lighting is ready again in four rooms.** Detector progress and the required checks have recovered. |

Do not describe unchanged “clear” sensor values as evidence that the detector is working.

#### Story 3: Spotify login expires

Authentication evidence is supported. Quiet-hour timing requires the story’s policy.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening · 07:00, held from 03:10 | **Backyard music needs attention.** Spotify needs a new login. Sign in again before you want to use it. |
| Update · still unresolved | **Backyard music is still blocked.** Spotify still needs a new login. |
| Recovery · after confirmed recovery | **Backyard music is ready again.** Spotify sign-in and the required checks have recovered. |

At 03:10 the problem is visible on the dashboard; the phone request waits until 07:00. A valid login alone does not prove every other requirement is ready.

#### Story 4: Motion sensor battery dies

Requires battery and device-originated freshness checks, plus a verified battery type for the remedy.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Early warning · morning digest | **Basement motion sensor battery is low.** Replace its battery soon. |
| Lost evidence · 08:00 digest | **Basement motion lighting has lost sensor evidence.** The motion sensor stopped reporting. Its last battery reading was low; a dead battery is the likely cause. |
| Recovery · after fresh evidence | **Basement motion sensor is reporting again.** Motion lighting is ready based on its current checks. |

Do not claim a battery was replaced without evidence. Timing must follow the device’s reporting contract; a daily heartbeat cannot be judged on a 15-minute threshold.

#### Story 5: Disk fills

Requires capacity/deadline evidence and an independently verified external watchdog.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Early warning · digest | **Home Assistant storage needs attention.** Free space is projected to run out in six days. Review storage use. |
| Escalation · deadline within 24 hours | **Home Assistant storage is nearly full.** Free space is projected to run out within 24 hours. Free space now. |
| External watchdog · if HA stops | **Home Assistant is not responding.** The external watchdog cannot reach it. Check the host; the last storage warning reported low free space. |
| Recovery · checks confirmed | **Home Assistant storage has recovered.** Current checks no longer report low free space. |

The watchdog sends through a path independent of HA. Do not claim the disk caused an outage solely from a previous warning.

#### Story 6: AI service and overdue updates

Requires an end-to-end inference check and a separate maintenance check.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening · service problem | **AI inference is unavailable.** The AI box is reachable, but the inference check failed. Check the AI service. |
| Separate maintenance message | **AI box updates are overdue.** Updates have been pending for ten months. Schedule maintenance. |
| Partial recovery | **AI inference has recovered.** The inference check passes again. AI box updates remain overdue. |
| Maintenance recovery · independently verified | **AI box updates are no longer overdue.** The maintenance check has cleared. |

Keep service and maintenance episodes separate. Maintenance follows its own digest/reminder/escalation policy.

#### Story 7: Backyard Eero fails

Requires supported Eero evidence and owner-declared speaker/function dependencies.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening | **Backyard music is blocked.** The backyard Eero node is unavailable. Check its power and network connection. |
| Update | **Backyard music remains blocked.** The backyard Eero node is still unavailable. |
| Recovery · all requirements confirmed | **Backyard music is ready again.** The Eero node and required speaker checks have recovered. |

A shared location does not create the Eero dependency. The dependency is explicitly declared.

#### Story 8: Garage close fails

Requires command-completion evidence; presence-dependent routing remains future work.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening · 23:10:30 | **The garage door did not close.** It is still open 30 seconds after the close command. Check the doorway and close it safely. |
| Update | **The garage door is still open.** The close command has not completed. |
| Recovery · closed state confirmed | **The garage door is closed.** Closure is confirmed; the command problem has resolved. |

Do not confuse this operation failure with an independently configured “left open” situation. Who is home determines recipients only when that routing is implemented.

#### Story 9: Insteon controller and devices

Requires controller warning and command-completion producers. Grouping semantics already belong to the library.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening | **The Insteon controller needs attention.** Its health check reports a warning. Check the controller. |
| Grouped update · same problem | **Insteon control is failing across 30 devices.** The failures are grouped under the controller problem. Check the controller first. |
| Partial recovery | **The controller has recovered; two devices still need attention.** The other 28 devices have recovered. Open the remaining device problems. |
| Final recovery · device checks confirmed | **The remaining Insteon devices have recovered.** No device problems remain from this incident. |

Remaining devices get their own problem identities. The resolved controller episode must not conceal them.

#### Story 10: Front door open overnight

The bound situation entity is supported. The 23:04 door-open time needs explicit source evidence; alert activation at 02:04 is a different timestamp.

| Stage | Proposed title and body |
| --- | --- |
| Opening · 02:04 | **Front door left open overnight.** The overnight door rule is active. Check and close the door. |
| Evidence lost · 02:10 | **No new phone request.** Keep the existing problem open. The source is unavailable; closure is not confirmed. |
| Stale · 02:25 | **Front door status is unknown.** The overnight alert remains open, and the house can no longer confirm whether the door is still open. Check the door. |
| Evidence returns · 02:30 | **Silent update: the overnight door rule is active again.** Keep the same problem open. |
| Resolution · 06:50 | **Silent resolution: front door alert cleared.** The rule reports clear after the door closes. |

Use “open since 23:04” only when the reporter supplies that evidence. Equipment failure or maintenance never clears or suppresses this situation.

### Next review

Review the overview priority, problem wording, amount of visible evidence, and location navigation. Then specify the frontend read/update contract and implement the first availability-backed dashboard increment. Keep richer producers and optional TopoMation enrichment separately tracked in the roadmap.


## 19. First live dashboard and HA walkthrough — 2026-09-25

The first read-only administrator dashboard now runs as an automatic HA sidebar panel, reusable cards and a community dashboard strategy. It uses the adapter's authenticated live read model and public library queries. Overview, function/problem details, HA area browsing, coverage and recent enrollment changes are implemented; this does not complete every presentation proposal above.

The [isolated real-HA walkthrough](testing/dashboard-walkthrough.md) passed native integration setup, function preview/configuration, availability failure and held recovery, future-source enrollment, native entity handoff, area reassignment, integration reload, generated-dashboard creation and full HA restart/reconnection. A return-navigation gap in embedded cards was found, fixed and covered by an executable browser regression.

The next milestone is the installable pilot build: combine the reviewed dashboard, controls and bounded resolved-history backend, release/pin the library prerequisite, then validate packaging and installation. Richer evidence producers, notification wording/delivery, operator UI, full history presentation and optional TopoMation enrichment remain separately tracked. The walkthrough's synthetic evidence is not real-house validation.

## 20. Device enrollment and runtime qualification — 2026-09-25

The first live owner question was why known offline devices were absent while their integration was watched, followed by how to manage several thousand entities. The current pilot's integration-only rule does not check device capabilities. Saved-registry assessment and isolated burst tests are recorded in the [runtime/device assessment](testing/runtime-scaling.md). Construction is fast, but runtime bursts cause repeated full scans and publications; broad live enrollment remains blocked on responsiveness work.

Proposed owner workflow: browse rooms and integrations, choose a recognizable device, then review the supported capabilities and evidence that will be watched. Keep entity details underneath that choice. A source without a device needs a separate searchable home, and a registry device without evidence must remain an explicit gap. Registry records can represent bridges, services or virtual groupings; their count is not a count of physical equipment.

Each device row should say what is monitored, what evidence is missing and why it is included or excluded. Device detail separates operational capabilities, connectivity evidence and maintenance. Offer bulk inclusion by device/integration/area, preview the resulting capability checks, persist exclusions and show whether new discoveries inherit the choice. Do not attach every entity on a selected device by default, or globally discard diagnostics: both can produce misleading coverage. These are proposals, not implemented enrollment profiles or new catalog rules.

The first bounded pilot proposal uses one availability capability on each of two already-offline devices. Other capabilities are added when a declared function needs them. Keep the existing integration checks and notifications off. The isolated two-device lifecycle and full registry-shape selection tests pass, but refresh scheduling and full inventory publication need correction and requalification before live expansion. Device views must preserve capability-level health and must not turn location or device grouping into dependency edges.


## 21. Resolved history and dashboard controls

Implemented 2026-09-25 in the isolated dashboard increment. The spec remains the behavior contract.

- Overview includes eight recently ended episodes and active controls. The history view searches retained source names, identities and findings, filters outcomes, and shows twenty records at a time. Stored evidence is never presented as current readiness. Removal and absorption do not imply recovery.
- Open problems offer shelving. Equipment capabilities offer maintenance; situations and functions cannot be maintenance roots. The owner supplies an explicit end date/time and optional reason. Maintenance previews capabilities, affected functions and existing episodes before applying.
- Form entries survive live updates, which invalidate maintenance previews. Disconnection and disappearance of the target disable submission. Pending actions cannot be double-submitted; an uncertain result calls for inspecting controls instead of an automatic retry.
- Backend scope, expiry, persistence and permission semantics remain unchanged. Cancellation and acknowledgment are still future work.
- Executable browser scenarios: `tests/frontend/history-controls.html`. Native WebSocket authorization and service response scenarios: `tests/test_dashboard_actions.py`.

Large-inventory transfer/rendering remains separate unfinished work. The concurrent device-monitoring task owns runtime performance qualification; the concurrent location task owns the native floor/area hierarchy. This increment does not change enrollment or either task's code.


## 22. Actionable problem details — 2026-09-25

The owner approved replacing the diagnostic-first problem presentation with a short practical brief. Lead with a recognizable source, what HA reports, confirmed effects on configured home functions, the relevant next step and current progress. Do not turn a lost connection into a claim that equipment has stopped physically working.

NuHeat timeouts suggest checking the NuHeat app; receiver timeouts suggest checking power and network. Request sign-in only when HA explicitly requires reauthentication. Keep disabled connections neutral and counted without assuming intent. During recovery confirmation, explain that the connection is running again and no action is needed yet.

Move alert and maintenance actions under **Manage this problem**. Keep active control expiry visible. Put timestamped original errors and filtered logs under **Technical details**, with raw policy/query data one level deeper under **Diagnostic data**. Empty dependency explanations, normal importance, notification implementation notes and broad verification disclaimers do not belong in the main problem brief.

The executable preview covers cloud timeout, receiver timeout, explicit sign-in, disabled and recovering states, plus unknown cause, safe text, real function impact and live disclosure preservation. The history/control fixture verifies existing actions and visible expiry notices. This increment changes presentation only; enrollment, health, recovery timing and notification decisions retain their existing contracts.


## 23. Navigation and bounded inventory updates — 2026-09-25

The standalone panel now keeps a hamburger beside its title. It opens Home
Assistant's native sidebar, including on phones and while monitoring is loading
or unavailable. Embedded cards keep the enclosing dashboard's global menu.
The executable menu scenario checks the native event, keyboard-accessible button,
touch target, unavailable states and embedded-card distinction.

House and coverage tables search the whole received catalog and render at most
50 sources per page. Page and search survive evidence updates. Compact subscriptions
replace static metadata on a changed catalog and retain it between normal updates.
Initial transfer remains a full catalog. A running synthetic HA instance verified
the phone menu through navigation to Settings, search for the last of 6,000 generated
entities, 50-row paging and page retention through a recovery update.

Runtime work now combines redundant refreshes while preserving every captured
transition. The narrow synthetic scope passed the proposed burst budgets with
real storage and WebSocket delivery. Broad 6,000-check monitoring remains
unqualified; see [the measured limits](testing/runtime-scaling.md). Device-first
grouping and selective capability profiles remain separate planned UI work.

## 24. Explain device capabilities

An entity name alone does not explain the problem. The owner brief now names the
capability (for example, Light or Occupancy sensor), its known area and provider,
then describes what HA cannot report or control. Light guidance starts with power
and a wall switch if present. Detection-sensor guidance starts with power/battery
and checking for a new reading. These are checks, not diagnoses of a failed device.

Native entity details and known device pages are directly reachable. A watched
owner connection needing attention is explained separately. Current public query
results drive both the card and dialog, including unknown evidence and recovery
confirmation; historical episode reasons never stand in for current state.
